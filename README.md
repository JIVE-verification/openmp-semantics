# openmp-semantics

**Than** 

1. I created a new branch for the VST code called OpenMP that works with Open-semantics. Anyone working on the project can clone it (https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/VST/tree/OpenMP) and work locally.
2. I fixed some errors caused by outdated libraries.
3. I'm currently focusing on `HybridMachine.v`, working with the `spawn` rule.
